        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Combine Ingredients:</b> In large pot add meat, onion, garlic, carrots,
                bay leaves and dried peppers. Cover with water. (This uses my large
                7 qt pot and fills it to the top!)
            </li>
            <li><b>Add Seasonings:</b> Add chicken bouillon, orgegano, cumin, salt,
                stir to combine. Bring to a boil.
            </li>
            <li><b>Skim:</b> After 30 minutes, skim the top of the pot to remove
                impurities from the bone cooking out. (Will look like little bits
                of foam on the top)
            </li>
            <li><b>Blend Peppers:</b> Remove the peppers (should be softened) and place
                in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth, add up to 
                1/4 cup of broth if needed to help get smooth consistency.
            </li>
            <li><b>Strain:</b> Strain the peppers if needed to remove bits of skin (if 
                using a high blender this step is not necessary).
            </li>
            <li><b>Combine:</b> Add the blended peppers into the broth and stir to comnbine</li>
            <li><b>Season:</b> Add in the chili powder as desired to get a nice deep red
                color to the broth.
            </li>
            <li><b>Simmer:</b> Cover and continue to simmer for about 3 hours or until
                meaat is tender and easily shredding on it's own. (remove lid and 
                give a stir every 40 minutes or so. Can also taste the broth once
                the meat is cooked through and adjust seasonings as needed).
            </li>
            <li><b>Remove Greases:</b> Skim the grease from the top of the broth (SAVE THIS!)
                pour the grease into a small skillet or saucepan, this is used for making
                the tacos if disired.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the onion, garlic, carrots, and bay leaves from the broth. (These
                ingredients were in the broth for flavoring...people are more than welcome
                to eat and enjoy them, so save them if you want!)
            </li>
            <li><b>Serving:</b> Remove the meat from the broth and cut into large chunks for 
                servings. Remove any bones.
            </li>
